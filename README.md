# kindle-snake
This project is a classic Snake game ported to Kindle 3. Original source from [google code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/snake-game-kindlet/)

###Installation
- you'll need a jailbroken Kindle
- copy 111developer.keystore```  to ```/var/local/java/keystore/```
- copy ```kSnake_1.0.azw2``` file to your Kindle's ```documents``` folder.
- reboot the device (```Menu - Settings - Menu - Restart```)
- enjoy :)

###Controls

Joystick controls the snake. Central joystick key or spacebar pauses the game.

###For developers

If you want to make your own kindlets, or modify this one, read the "How to write Kindlets" guide.

Please sign your kindlets with the keystore from that guide, so that the users don't have to copy a new keystore each time.
